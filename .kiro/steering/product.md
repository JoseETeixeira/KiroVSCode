# Product Overview

## Purpose

Kiro-Style Copilot is a VS Code extension that transforms GitHub Copilot into a powerful, mode-aware development assistant modeled after the Kiro IDE workflow. The extension provides two distinct development modes:

1. **Vibe Coding Mode**: Chat-first, exploratory development for rapid prototyping and unclear requirements
2. **Spec Mode**: Plan-first, structured development with requirements, design, and task breakdown before implementation

## Key Features

### Current Features
- Dual-mode workflow (Vibe/Spec)
- @kiro chat participant with mode-specific behaviors
- Task detection from tasks.md files
- Custom prompt integration
- Mode selector and task context tree views
- Activity bar integration
- Automatic task scanning

### Target Features (Next Generation)
- Native Copilot Chat interface integration (replacing custom chat participant)
- In-chat mode selection UI (eliminating .github folder configuration)
- Contextual document navigation for specs (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- Task execution from context menu in tasks.md files
- Visual progress indicators for multi-step workflows
- Integrated spec/steering/hooks management UI
- Streamlined, less verbose workflow execution

## Target Users

- Developers who want structured, mode-aware AI assistance
- Teams transitioning from Kiro IDE to VS Code
- Engineers who value both rapid prototyping and formal requirements
- Projects requiring documentation and traceability alongside code

## Objectives

1. Provide a seamless Kiro-like experience within VS Code
2. Eliminate manual configuration and folder setup
3. Enable intuitive mode switching and task execution
4. Maintain clear visibility into workflow progress
5. Support both exploratory and structured development approaches
6. Preserve all existing functionality while modernizing the UX
