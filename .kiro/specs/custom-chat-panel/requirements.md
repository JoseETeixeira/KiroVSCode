# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a custom chat panel to the Kiro VS Code extension that provides a native chat interface similar to vscode-copilot-chat. The chat panel will integrate Kiro's workflow modes (Vibe and Spec), enable mode selection directly within the chat UI, and operate as a full agent capable of autonomous file system operations. This replaces the current @kiro chat participant approach with a more integrated, visual experience.

## Glossary

-   **Chat Panel**: A custom webview-based UI panel in VS Code that displays conversational interactions between the user and the Kiro agent
-   **Kiro Agent**: The AI assistant that processes user requests, executes workflows, and performs file operations autonomously
-   **Vibe Mode**: An exploratory, chat-first development mode for rapid prototyping
-   **Spec Mode**: A structured, plan-first development mode with requirements, design, and task phases
-   **Workflow**: A multi-step process (e.g., requirements → design → tasks) that the agent executes
-   **File Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete actions on files and folders in the workspace
-   **Mode Selector**: A UI component within the chat panel that allows users to switch between Vibe and Spec modes
-   **Message Stream**: Real-time display of agent responses as they are generated
-   **Action Buttons**: Interactive UI elements in the chat that trigger specific operations (e.g., "Apply Changes", "View File")

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat Panel SHALL display a mode selector component at the top of the interface
2. THE Mode Selector SHALL show the currently active mode (Vibe or Spec)
3. WHEN the user clicks the mode selector, THE Chat Panel SHALL display a dropdown with available modes

4. THE Chat Panel SHALL render markdown content in agent responses with proper formatting
5. THE Chat Panel SHALL display code blocks with syntax highlighting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Kiro agent to create, read, edit, and delete files autonomously, so that I can request changes and have them applied automatically

6. THE Kiro Agent SHALL create directories as needed when creating files in non-existent paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see what file operations the agent is performing, so that I maintain awareness of changes to my workspace

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Chat Panel SHALL group multiple file operations into a collapsible section
3. WHEN the agent creates or modifies a file, THE Chat Panel SHALL display an action button to open the file in the editor
4. THE Chat Panel SHALL display a summary of all file operations after completing a workflow step
5. WHEN the agent encounters an error during a file operation, THE Chat Panel SHALL display the error message with context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to execute Kiro workflows (requirements, design, tasks), so that I can build features using the structured spec approach

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in Spec Mode, THE Kiro Agent SHALL execute the requirements phase when the user describes a feature
2. WHEN the requirements phase completes, THE Kiro Agent SHALL prompt the user for approval before proceeding to design
3. WHEN the design phase completes, THE Kiro Agent SHALL prompt the user for approval before proceeding to tasks
4. THE Chat Panel SHALL display workflow progress indicators showing the current phase
5. WHEN executing tasks, THE Kiro Agent SHALL update task checkboxes in tasks.md files as tasks complete

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time streaming of agent responses, so that I can see the agent's thinking process as it works

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent generates a response, THE Chat Panel SHALL display the text incrementally as it is received
2. THE Chat Panel SHALL auto-scroll to show the latest content during streaming
3. WHEN the agent completes a response, THE Chat Panel SHALL display a completion indicator
4. THE Chat Panel SHALL allow the user to stop response generation mid-stream
5. WHEN streaming is interrupted, THE Chat Panel SHALL display a partial response with an interruption indicator

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with code snippets in the chat, so that I can quickly apply or copy suggested code

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent displays a code block, THE Chat Panel SHALL render an action toolbar above the code
2. THE Code Block Toolbar SHALL include a "Copy" button to copy code to clipboard
3. THE Code Block Toolbar SHALL include an "Insert at Cursor" button to insert code at the current editor position
4. WHERE a file path is specified in the code block, THE Code Block Toolbar SHALL include an "Apply to File" button
5. WHEN the user clicks "Apply to File", THE Kiro Agent SHALL write the code to the specified file

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reference files and folders in my chat messages, so that I can provide context to the agent

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat Panel SHALL support #File syntax to reference specific files
