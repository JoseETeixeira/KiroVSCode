# Automatic Task Completion Tracking

## Overview

The Kiro extension now includes automatic task completion tracking that monitors task execution and can automatically mark tasks as complete when success indicators are detected.

## Features

### 1. Active Task Tracking

When you execute a task using the "Execute Task with Kiro" context menu or command, the extension automatically:

-   Sets the task as the "active task"
-   Tracks the task number and file path
-   Monitors for completion indicators

### 2. Success Detection

The tracker looks for common success indicators in responses, including:

-   "task complete" or "task is complete"
-   "successfully implemented"
-   "implementation complete"
-   "finished implementing"
-   "all tasks complete" or "all sub-tasks complete"
-   Checkmark symbols (✓, ✅) followed by "complete"
-   "done implementing"
-   "implementation successful"

### 3. Automatic Checkbox Updates

When a task is marked complete:

-   The checkbox in tasks.md is automatically updated from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
-   Requirement references and annotations are preserved
-   The spec explorer tree view is refreshed to show the updated status
-   A notification is displayed confirming the completion

### 4. Manual Controls

You can also manually control task completion tracking:

#### Mark Active Task Complete

**Command:** `Kiro: Mark Active Task Complete`

Manually marks the currently active task as complete without waiting for automatic detection.

#### Show Active Task

**Command:** `Kiro: Show Active Task`

Displays information about the currently tracked task (if any).

#### Clear Active Task Tracking

**Command:** `Kiro: Clear Active Task Tracking`

Clears the active task without marking it complete. Useful if you want to stop tracking a task.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Execute a Task**

    - Right-click on a task line in any tasks.md file
    - Select "Execute Task with Kiro"
    - The task is automatically set as the active task

2. **Work on the Task**

    - Implement the task using Kiro's assistance
    - The tracker monitors the conversation

3. **Automatic Completion**

    - When you or Kiro indicates the task is complete, it's automatically marked
    - The checkbox updates and tree view refreshes

4. **Manual Completion (Optional)**
    - If automatic detection doesn't trigger, use `Kiro: Mark Active Task Complete`
    - Or manually edit the tasks.md file

### Example

```markdown
# tasks.md before execution

-   [ ] 1. Implement user authentication
    -   Create login form
    -   Add password validation
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

# After automatic completion

-   [x] 1. Implement user authentication
    -   Create login form
    -   Add password validation
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_
```

## Implementation Details

### TaskCompletionTracker Service

The `TaskCompletionTracker` service manages the tracking lifecycle:

```typescript
// Set active task when execution starts
taskCompletionTracker.setActiveTask(filePath, taskNumber);

// Detect completion in responses
const isComplete = taskCompletionTracker.detectTaskCompletion(responseText);

// Manually mark complete
await taskCompletionTracker.markActiveTaskComplete();

// Clear tracking
taskCompletionTracker.clearActiveTask();
```

### Integration Points

1. **executeTask Command**: Automatically sets the active task when a task is executed
2. **Tree View Refresh**: Connected to the SpecExplorerProvider for automatic UI updates
3. **TaskManager**: Uses the existing `markTaskComplete()` method to update files

## Benefits

-   **Reduced Manual Work**: No need to manually update checkboxes after completing tasks
-   **Better Tracking**: Always know which task you're currently working on
-   **Automatic Updates**: Tree view and file system stay in sync
-   **Flexible Control**: Automatic detection with manual override options

## Limitations

-   Detection is based on text patterns and may not catch all completion scenarios
-   Only one task can be tracked at a time
-   Requires explicit task execution through the extension (not manual chat)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

-   Multiple concurrent task tracking
-   Configurable success indicators
-   Integration with chat completion events for more reliable detection
-   Task progress tracking (not just complete/incomplete)
-   Automatic sub-task completion when parent task completes
